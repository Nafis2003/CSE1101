# 💻 CSE1111 Solved Codes – 1st Semester (RUET EEE)

Welcome! This repository contains all the codes I wrote during my first semester **CSE1111: Computer Programming** course at RUET (EEE).

Organized by topic and problem type, this collection is meant to help you:
- 📘 Revise concepts
- 🔍 Understand how the code works
- 🚀 Practice solving problems the right way

> **📌 Reminder:** These codes are meant for learning. Don't just copy—try to *understand the logic* behind each line. Tweak it. Break it. Fix it. That’s how you grow.

## ✉️ Need Help?
Stuck on a problem or confused about the logic? Feel free to reach out.
I'll help if I can—but don’t expect spoon-feeding 😎.
