# 💻 CSE1111 Solved Codes – 1st Semester (RUET EEE)

Welcome! This repo contains all the codes I wrote during my 1st semester **CSE1111: Computer Programming** course at RUET (EEE).

Organized by lab number and problem type, this collection is here to help you:
- 📘 Revise core C programming concepts
- 🧠 Understand how and *why* the code works
- 🚀 Practice the right way, not the shortcut way

> **⚠️ Note:** These codes are for learning, not copy-paste submissions. Read the logic, tweak things, and make it your own.

## 🗂️ File Naming Convention

Each file is named based on the lab it came from and the type of problem:

- `labXexY.c` → **Example Y** from **Lab X**
- `labXpZ.c` → **Practice Problem Z** from **Lab X**

For example:
- `lab3ex1.c` → Example 1 from Lab 3
- `lab4p2.c` → Practice problem 2 from Lab 4

This structure keeps everything clean, predictable, and easy to follow.

## 🔎 What’s Inside?
- Well-commented source code
- Core concepts like I/O, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, etc.
- Extra practice problems beyond what was taught in class
- Ready-to-run `.c` files for compiling in any C IDE or terminal

Made with caffeine, logic errors, and trial & error.
